# Little Camera Switcher

A special purpose keyboard with 15 keys, intended for hotkeying camera switches in Open Broadcast Studio. It's just a keyboard built with the Teensy 2.0, but it's made to be flexible and magnetic so it can attach to flat or curved metal surfaces.

This repository includes the Arduino sketches, CAD models in Rhino and STL format, and PCB layout in KiCad and Gerber. I fabricated the flex circuit on Pyralux using milling, but you can also use photochemical etching or toner transfer.
